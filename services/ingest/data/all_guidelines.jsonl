{"input_prompt": "finetuning Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning: Resource efficiency: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly. Cost-effectiveness: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.

Weaknesses: - Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck.

Weaknesses: - No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data. - Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated? - IAM lacks depth.

{"input_prompt": "Cost-effectiveness: B Strengths: - Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic. - Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.

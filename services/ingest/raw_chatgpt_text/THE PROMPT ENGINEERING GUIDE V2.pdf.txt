Guide Overview
This prompt engineering doc is designed to optimize your ideation process and enhance your output quality. The document is comprised of two main types of prompts: simple prompts and advanced prompts. The simpliﬁed prompts are ideal for generating quick ideas and obtaining concise answers with minimal eﬀort. On the other hand, the advanced prompts delve into the intricacies of crafting detailed inputs that yield comprehensive outputs suitable for personal and business purposes.

What is Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts used in natural language processing (NLP) models, such as ChatGPT, chatbots, or virtual assistants. This involves crafting prompts that are clear, concise, and eﬀective in eliciting the desired response. (Aka prompt engineering is like making an eﬀective ﬁshing lure - just as a well-designed lure is more likely to catch the ﬁsh you want, a well-crafted prompt is more likely to elicit the desired response.)
3 Principles of Prompt Engineering 
1.Be speciﬁc: The more criteria you give, the more focused the output will be.
2.Work in steps: Break tasks into small chunks. This returns better results, just as it would with a human. 
3.Iterate and improve: Re-work the inputs and have ChatGPT improve on its own output.
What Makes a Good Prompt
Great outputs all come down to the data the model was trained on, its parameters, and good prompting. Since we can only control one of these, here’s what good prompting boils down to:
•Clear and concise language that is direct and unambiguous. 
•The persona that you assign to ChatGPT, aka who it will be acting as in your prompt.
•The information and examples that you provide, aka your input. (information and examples can be referenced by ChatGPT in the previous chat history)
•A speciﬁc task that you are requesting ChatGPT to complete, aka your desired output. •Reﬁnement as needed once you receive your ﬁrst response, aka reiteration until receiving the desired output.

Main Prompting Steps
1.Deﬁne the problem or goal: Clearly articulate what you want ChatGPT to help you with and what kind of response you are looking for.
2.Use relevant keywords and phrases: Input the most useful industry and topic-related terms into the prompt, which will help guide ChatGPT toward generating the desired response.
3.Write the prompt: Craft a concise prompt that clearly communicates the information and task that is required, using the keywords and phrases identiﬁed in steps 1 and 2.
4.Test, evaluate, and iterate: Generate responses with ChatGPT, evaluate the results, and adjust the prompt as necessary to elicit the desired response. Repeat the process until a successful prompt is created that consistently generates the desired response.
Prompt Priming
“Priming” refers to the practice of providing some initial input to the model before generating a response. The initial input is intended to guide the model toward generating a response that is more relevant and coherent with the user's intended output. (You can input entire pieces of text you’ve written for ChatGPT to be trained on)*

Example 1
Without priming: Where should I go on my next vacation? 
With priming: I’d like to go on a trip with my wife and kids, the location should be tropical, we’d love to be close to the beach, I’d like the ﬂight to be one direct ﬂight to and from LAX, and I have a travel budget of $5,000. Where should I go on my next vacation?
Priming Output: One suggestion for your tropical family vacation within a $5,000 budget could be Cancun, Mexico. Direct ﬂights from LAX are available, and you can ﬁnd aﬀordable all-inclusive packages with prices starting at around $1,000 per person for a week-long stay. Popular family activities in Cancun include snorkeling, visiting ancient ruins, and exploring local beaches and restaurants.
Example 2
Without priming: Please create 3 potential titles for my new online course that teaches how to use AI. 
With priming: Please create 3 potential titles for my new online course that teaches how to use AI. Here is an example of my recent course titles, please emulate the styling and written format of these: “Video Editing Masterclass: Edit Your Videos Like a Pro!” “Cinematography Masterclass: The Complete Videography Guide”
Priming Output: 1. AI Mastery: The Complete Guide to Using Artiﬁcial Intelligence

In contrast to conventional search engines, ChatGPT possesses a unique memory capacity. It eﬀectively retains information conveyed during prior conversations, thereby enabling future prompts to be informed by the complete conversation history. This feature is particularly useful, as it allows ChatGPT to understand context and subtleties  by the accumulation of knowledge in one chain of dialogue.

Prompt Formula •Role - ChatGPT’s persona (You are an expert marketer)
•Result - Desired output (Create 5 emails ending with a call to action)
•Goal - Purpose of the output (The goal is to drive sales to my product)
•Context - Who, what, where, why (The emails are for my online audience of entrepreneurs)
•Constraint - Limitations and guidelines (The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words)
Examples •You are an expert [role]. Create [result]. The goal is [end goal]. The content is for [context]. Your guidelines for writing are [constraints].
•You are an expert marketer. Create 5 emails ending with a call to action. The goal is to drive sales to my product. The emails are for my online audience of entrepreneurs. The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words.
•You are an expert nutritionist. Create a 7 day meal plan for my 5 foot 7, 40 year old, female client who exercises 3 times a week. The goal is for her to lose 1 pound of fat a week by being in a caloric deﬁcit and eating the right amount of carbs, sugar, and protein. She doesn’t eat pork and wants to spend $200 per week on food. The meal plan should give the recipes, cooking directions, preparation times, and a speciﬁc meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Presented below are a set of general prompt frameworks designed to be applicable to all scenarios while still generating detailed and eﬀective outputs. By providing the following frameworks, these prompts enable ChatGPT to produce more helpful and accurate responses on a consistent basis.
I Want You To Act As Prompting: This second option presents another robust structure that can be applied universally to any input and intended output. Its objective is to establish a standardized format that optimizes the framing for ChatGPT and thereby enhances its performance across a broad spectrum of inputs. 
Prompt Formula 1.“I want you to act as a…” (historian, biologist, etc.) This helps to set the stage for ChatGPT’s persona.
2.“I will give you…” (my target audience, a speciﬁc direction, a product, etc.) This is where you set up the dynamic between you and ChatGPT.
3.“You will then…” (create 5 emails, make a video script, summarize, etc.)
4.“In a _____ tone/style…” (upbeat, professional, tabular format) This is where you explain your desired output along with the personality/style of writing for the output.
5.“The important details are…” (target audience, cost per project, etc.) Be sure to explain all important details and elaborate on speciﬁcs from bullet point 2.
6.Reﬁne your output as needed “Be more persuasive” “Put the most important keywords in bold” “Now put this in tabular format”
Examples •I want you to act as a personal coach. I will give you my personal and professional goals. You will then create a 7 day schedule in tabular format for me to follow in order to hit my goals. My short term daily goals are meditate, workout, read, and work on my projects. My long term goals are to sign 30 new clients and save  $10,000 over the next 6 months.
•I want you to act as a virtual doctor. I will describe my symptoms and you will provide a diagnosis and treatment plan.

What  is  Prompt  engineering ?
Prompt  engineering  is  the  process  of  creating  prompts  or  asking  or
instructions  that  guide  the  output  of  a  language  model  like  ChatGPT . It
allows  u sers  to  control  the  ou tput  of  the  model  and  genera te  text  that
is tailored  to  their  speciﬁc  needs .
ChatGPT  is  a  state-of-the-ar t  language  model  that  is  capable  of
generating  human-like  text . It  is  built  on  the  transformer  a rchitecture ,
which  allows  it  to  handle  lar ge  amounts  of  data  and  generate  high-
quality  text .
However , in  order  to  get  th e  best  results  from  ChatGPT , it  is
important  to  understand  how  to  properly  prompt  the  model .
Prompting  allo ws  users  to  control  the  output  of  the  mo del  and
generate  text  that  is  relevant , accurate , and  of  high-quality .
When  w orking  with  ChatGPT , it  is  important  to  understand  its
capabilities  and  limitations .
The model  is  c apable  of  generating  human-like  text , but  it  may  not
always  produce  the  desired  output  without  proper  guidance .
This  is  where  prompt  engineering  comes  in , by  providing  clear  and
speciﬁc  instruc tions , you  can  guide  the  model's  output  and  ensure  that
it is relevant .
A prompt  formula  is  a  speciﬁc  format  for  the  prompt , it  is  generally
composed  of  3 main  elements :
task: a  clear  a nd  concise  statement  of  what  the  prompt  is
asking  the  model  to  generate .
instructions : the  instructions  that  should  be  followed  by  the
model  when  generating  text .
role: the  role  that  the  model  should  take  on  when  generating
text.
In t his  book , we  will  explo re  the  various  prompt  engineering
techniques  that  can  be  used  with  ChatGPT . W e  will  discuss  the
dif ferent  types  of  prompts , as  well  as  how  to  use  them  to  achieve
speciﬁc  goals  you  want .
Chapter  2: Instructions  Prompt  T echnique
Now , let  us  start  by  exploring  the  “instructions  prompt  technique”

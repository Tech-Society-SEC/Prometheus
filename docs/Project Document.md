# Project Design Document: Intelligent Prompt Augmentation Engine

**Project Codename:** Prometheus <br>
**Version:** 1.0 <br>
---

### 1. Vision & Mission

* **Vision:** To empower every user, from novice to expert, to unlock the full potential of any Generative AI model through masterfully crafted prompts.
* **Mission:** To create an intelligent tool that automatically analyzes a user's initial prompt and enhances it based on a knowledge base of model-specific best practices, thereby improving the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the AI's response.

### 2. Problem Statement

The quality of output from Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally dependent on the quality of the input prompt. However, best practices for prompting are often nuanced, model-specific (e.g., Gemini's best practices differ from ChatGPT's or Claude's), and not widely known by the average user. This leads to:
* Sub-optimal, generic, or incorrect AI responses.
* Increased time and effort spent on re-prompting.
* Frustration and underutilization of powerful AI capabilities.
* Inefficient use of API credits and computational resources.

Our tool will bridge this gap by serving as an expert "prompt engineer" for the user.

### 3. Goals & Objectives

* **Primary Goal:** To develop a system that programmatically enhances user prompts for a selection of target LLMs.
* **Key Objectives (SMART):**
    * **Specific:** The tool will accept a raw text prompt and a target model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus). It will output one or more refined prompts.
    * **Measurable:** Success will be measured by user feedback ratings on prompt quality and a qualitative analysis showing a >50% improvement in response clarity from the target LLM using the enhanced prompt vs. the original.
    * **Achievable:** The project leverages a hybrid Fine-tuned + RAG architecture, which is a technically sound and feasible approach for this problem.
    * **Relevant:** This directly addresses a major pain point in the current AI interaction landscape. As a GATE CS aspirant, building this project will give you deep, practical experience in modern NLP, model fine-tuning, and system design.
    * **Time-bound:** A functional prototype (MVP) is to be developed within 16 weeks.

### 4. Scope

#### In-Scope:

* **Prompt Analysis:** The tool will identify the user's core intent and detect missing elements like context, constraints, persona, or output format.
* **Model-Specific Augmentation:** It will apply specific enhancement strategies based on the selected target LLM.
* **Core Technology:** A fine-tuned language model augmented by a RAG pipeline.
* **Knowledge Base:** A vector database containing prompting guidelines, techniques, and examples for major LLMs.
* **Interface:** A simple web-based UI for manual input and an API for programmatic access.

#### Out-of-Scope (for Version 1.0):

* **Real-time chat integration or browser extensions:** These can be considered for future versions. (We'll try our best to release within this semester)

### 5. Technical Design & Architecture

This project is built on a hybrid **Fine-tuned AI - RAG Model**.

* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** This provides the *knowledge*. Our updatable vector store contains model-specific prompting guidelines, which are retrieved at runtime.
* **Fine-tuning:** This provides the *skill*. The base model is trained to understand the *pattern* of transforming a raw prompt into an expert prompt, using the retrieved knowledge as context.

#### System Workflow:
![System Workflow Diagram](<images/System Workflow.png>)
1.  **Input:** User provides a `raw_prompt` and a `target_model`.
2.  **Retrieval (RAG):** The system queries a **Vector Database** using the `target_model` to fetch relevant prompting best practices.
3.  **Augmentation (Fine-tuned Model):** Our fine-tuned model receives the `raw_prompt` and the retrieved `context`.
4.  **Generation:** The model synthesizes this information to generate one or more `enhanced_prompts`.
5.  **Output:** The `enhanced_prompt` is returned to the user.

#### Component Stack:

* **Frontend:** React/Vue.js or static HTML with htmx.
* **Backend API:** Python with FastAPI or Flask.
* **Core LLM (for fine-tuning):** Llama 3 8B, Mistral 7B, or Google's Gemma.
* **Vector Database (for RAG):** ChromaDB, FAISS, or Pinecone.
* **Data Corpus (Knowledge Base):** Curated from official AI documentation, blogs, academic papers, etc.

### 6. Project Phases & Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Collection (Weeks 1-2)
* **Task 1:** Set up the development environment (Docker recommended).
* **Task 2:** Build the knowledge base by scraping and cleaning documentation.
* **Task 3:** Create the initial fine-tuning dataset (~1,000+ examples).
* **Deliverable:** A curated knowledge base and a preliminary fine-tuning dataset.

#### Phase 2: Core Model Development (Weeks 3-5)
* **Task 1:** Select and set up the base LLM for fine-tuning.
* **Task 2:** Set up the Vector Database and ingest the knowledge base.
* **Task 3:** Implement RAG retrieval logic.
* **Task 4:** Fine-tune the base LLM on the dataset.
* **Deliverable:** A functional fine-tuned RAG model.

#### Phase 3: Application & API (Weeks 6-7)
* **Task 1:** Develop backend API endpoints.
* **Task 2:** Build the minimalist frontend UI.
* **Task 3:** Integrate the model with the backend.
* **Deliverable:** A working end-to-end application prototype (MVP).

#### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 8)
* **Task 1:** Conduct internal and user acceptance testing (UAT).
* **Task 2:** Refine the model and UI based on feedback.
* **Task 3:** Deploy the application.
* **Deliverable:** Version 1.0 of Project Prometheus is live.

### 7. Risks & Mitigation

* **Risk:** The "enhanced" prompt is not objectively better.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement A/B testing and a user feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down) to continually refine the model.
* **Risk:** Scarcity of high-quality fine-tuning data.
    * **Mitigation:** Use a powerful LLM (e.g., via API) to synthetically generate more training examples.
* **Risk:** Keeping the RAG knowledge base current.
    * **Mitigation:** Develop automated scripts to periodically check for and ingest new prompting guidelines from key sources.
